# Product Requirements Document: Personal Growth OS

## Executive Summary

Personal Growth OS is a web application that transforms personal development into an engaging, narrative-driven experience by incorporating RPG elements into a structured growth system. The application operates on a monthly cycle, requiring only about 45 minutes per month while maximizing engagement through gamification and storytelling. The system utilizes a single responsive Progressive Web App (PWA) that adapts to different devices, with optimized interfaces for both quick mobile interactions and deeper desktop reflection sessions, enhanced by AI-powered transformation of written content into game elements.

## Problem Statement

Traditional personal development tools often suffer from:
- Lack of sustained engagement and motivation
- Disconnection between goals and deeper personal meaning
- Excessive time requirements leading to abandonment
- Abstract progress that's difficult to visualize or measure
- Focus on singular aspects rather than holistic development

Personal Growth OS addresses these challenges by creating a narrative framework that makes growth engaging, meaningful, and visually trackable with minimal time investment.
