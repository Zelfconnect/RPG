# Technology Stack: Personal Growth OS

## Frontend Technology

### Framework/Library
- **React (via Create React App)**: We'll use React as our primary frontend library for its component-based architecture, which aligns well with our modular UI needs. Create React App provides a beginner-friendly setup with no build configuration needed.

### UI Component Libraries
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling, we'll use Tailwind CSS which provides utility classes that make it easy to create consistent, responsive designs without writing custom CSS. This is beginner-friendly while still allowing for sophisticated UI.
- **Heroicons**: Simple, attractive icon set that integrates well with Tailwind
- **React Router**: For handling navigation between different screens
- **Framer Motion**: For animations and transitions (simplified usage for beginners)

### State Management
- **React Context API with useReducer**: For simpler global state management without introducing Redux complexity
- **Local Storage**: For persisting certain user preferences and data locally

## Backend Technology

### Firebase Platform
For beginners, we'll leverage Firebase as our complete backend solution:

- **Firebase Authentication**: Handles user registration, login, and profile management
- **Firestore Database**: NoSQL database for storing user data, character information, quests, etc.
- **Firebase Storage**: For storing user-uploaded images or assets
- **Firebase Hosting**: For deploying the application

This approach eliminates the need to set up and maintain a separate backend server, making it much more accessible for beginners.

## Database

### Database Type
- **Firestore (NoSQL)**: Document-based database that's part of Firebase

### Data Models
The primary collections in our Firestore database will be:

1. **users**
   ```
   {
     uid: string,
     email: string,
     displayName: string,
     createdAt: timestamp,
     lastLogin: timestamp
   }
   ```

2. **characters**
   ```
   {
     userId: string,
     name: string,
     level: number,
     xp: number,
     stats: {
       mind: number,
       body: number,
       heart: number,
       spirit: number,
       craft: number,
       influence: number
     },
     originStory: string,
     currentChapter: string,
     futureVision: string,
     createdAt: timestamp,
     updatedAt: timestamp
   }
   ```

3. **quests**
   ```
   {
     userId: string,
     title: string,
     description: string,
     type: string, // "main", "side", "daily", etc.
     difficulty: number,
     status: string, // "active", "completed", "failed"
     progress: number, // 0-100
     xpReward: number,
     statRewards: {
       mind: number,
       body: number,
       // etc.
     },
     relatedSkills: array,
     startDate: timestamp,
     endDate: timestamp,
     completedDate: timestamp
   }
   ```

4. **skills**
   ```
   {
     userId: string,
     name: string,
     category: string, // "mind", "body", etc.
     level: number,
     description: string,
     prerequisites: array,
     unlocks: array,
     progress: number
   }
   ```

5. **monthlyChapters**
   ```
   {
     userId: string,
     month: number,
     year: number,
     title: string,
     narrative: string,
     focusAreas: array,
     completedQuests: array,
     reflections: string,
     xpGained: number,
     statsGained: object
   }
   ```

## DevOps & Deployment

### Hosting Environment
- **Firebase Hosting**: Simple deployment solution integrated with our backend

### CI/CD Approach
- **GitHub + GitHub Actions**: For version control and simple automated deployment
  - Automatic deployment to Firebase when pushing to main branch
  - Test workflows for pull requests

### Monitoring Strategy
- **Firebase Analytics**: Basic usage analytics
- **Firebase Crashlytics**: Error reporting
- **Firebase Performance Monitoring**: Performance tracking

## Architecture Overview

### System Components

1. **Authentication Layer**
   - Handles user registration and login
   - Manages user sessions and security
   - Connects to Firebase Authentication

2. **Data Access Layer**
   - Manages all interactions with Firestore database
   - Provides hooks and utilities for data operations
   - Handles caching and offline capabilities

3. **UI Component Layer**
   - Reusable UI components following design system
   - Screen-specific components for different views
   - Animation and interaction components

4. **Business Logic Layer**
   - Character progression system
   - Quest management
   - Skill development algorithms
   - XP and leveling mechanics

5. **Narrative Engine**
   - Generates and manages story elements
   - Integrates user input into narrative framework
   - Provides context for quests and achievements

### Data Flow

1. **User Authentication Flow**
   ```
   User Input → Firebase Auth → Auth State → Protected Routes
   ```

2. **Character Creation Flow**
   ```
   User Input → Form Validation → Firestore Write → Character State → UI Update
   ```

3. **Quest Management Flow**
   ```
   Quest Creation → Firestore Write → Quest List → Progress Updates → Completion → XP/Rewards Calculation → Character Update
   ```

4. **Skill Development Flow**
   ```
   Quest Completion → XP Distribution → Skill Progress Calculation → Level Check → Skill Tree Update
   ```

5. **Monthly Cycle Flow**
   ```
   Time Trigger → Previous Month Data → Monthly Summary Generation → User Review → New Month Initialization
   ```

### Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Security**
   - Firebase Authentication handles secure user authentication
   - Email verification for new accounts
   - Password strength requirements

2. **Data Access Control**
   - Firestore security rules to ensure users only access their own data
   - Backend validation for all data operations

3. **Client-Side Security**
   - Form validation to prevent invalid data
   - Protection against XSS with React's built-in protections
   - CSRF protection via Firebase's token-based authentication

4. **Sensitive Data Handling**
   - No storage of sensitive personal information beyond basic profile data
   - Option for users to export or delete their data completely
