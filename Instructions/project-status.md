## Next Steps
1. ✅ Enhance Character Attribute System with 0-10 scale and weighted scoring
2. ✅ Improve Current State Assessment with self-ratings and activity frequency
3. Set up responsive PWA configuration
4. Create Quest system with attribute growth mechanics
5. Develop Achievements system

* Need to implement proper loading states for async operations
* ~~Runtime errors when handling undefined character data~~ (Fixed with defensive programming)

## Notes
The project now has a solid foundation with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. The authentication flow is fully implemented with user profile creation and management. The dashboard displays character stats and progress. 

Recent improvements focused on enhancing the character attribute system with a more refined 0-10 scale and sophisticated weighted scoring algorithm. We implemented:

1. **Advanced Text Analysis**: Enhanced the `analyzeTextForAttributes` function with weighted keywords and negative indicators to provide more nuanced scoring.

2. **Dynamic Weight Adjustment**: Updated the attribute calculation system to dynamically adjust weights based on available data sources (self-ratings, activity frequency, text analysis).

3. **Improved Activity Scoring**: Enhanced the activity frequency scoring with secondary contributions, where certain activities can affect multiple attributes.

4. **Visual Attribute Display**: Upgraded the StatCard component with attribute level labels, descriptive text, and color coding based on attribute values.

5. **Enhanced Current State Assessment**: Improved the user interface for self-ratings with visual indicators, descriptions, and meaningful feedback about how choices affect attributes. Added emoji icons and color coding to make the interface more engaging and informative.

6. **Activity Frequency Impact Explanations**: Added detailed explanations of how activity frequency choices affect character attributes, providing users with a clear understanding of how their habits influence their character development.

These changes significantly improve the accuracy and presentation of character attributes, providing users with more meaningful feedback about their personal growth journey.

Updates to this status document should be made regularly as features are implemented.
