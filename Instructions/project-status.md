2. Improve Current State Assessment with self-ratings and activity frequency
3. Set up responsive PWA configuration
4. Create Quest system with attribute growth mechanics
5. Develop Achievements system
6. Build Skill Tree visualization
7. Implement Monthly Cycle features

## Known Issues
* Need to implement proper error handling for Firebase operations
* Need to add form validation for user inputs
* Need to implement proper loading states for async operations
* ~~Runtime errors when handling undefined character data~~ (Fixed with defensive programming)

## Notes
The project now has a solid foundation with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. The authentication flow is fully implemented with user profile creation and management. The dashboard displays character stats and progress. 

Recent improvements focused on enhancing the character creation flow with better UI styling and robust error handling. We implemented defensive programming techniques across all character-related components to prevent runtime errors when handling potentially undefined or null values. Specific improvements include:

1. **CharacterCreation.tsx**: Added proper error handling for loading character data, with try/catch blocks and type checking for loaded data. Enhanced navigation logic with safer property access.

2. **CharacterSummary.tsx**: Implemented defensive coding to handle undefined values in character data, ensuring the component can gracefully handle missing data without crashing.

3. **FutureSelfSnapshot.tsx**: Added safety checks for initialData, ensuring proper initialization of state variables and form validation even when data is incomplete.

4. **CurrentStateAssessment.tsx**: Enhanced type safety for activityFrequency and selfRatings objects, with proper default values and type checking to prevent runtime errors.

These changes significantly improve the application's stability and user experience by preventing unexpected crashes during the character creation process.

Updates to this status document should be made regularly as features are implemented.
