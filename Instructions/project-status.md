## Next Steps
1. Implement Character Creation flow
2. Create Daily Quests functionality
3. Develop Achievements system
4. Build Skill Tree visualization
5. Implement Monthly Cycle features

## Known Issues
* Need to implement proper error handling for Firebase operations
* Need to add form validation for user inputs
* Need to implement proper loading states for async operations

## Notes
The project now has a solid foundation with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. The authentication flow is fully implemented with user profile creation and management. The dashboard displays character stats and progress. The next phase will focus on implementing the character creation flow and quest system.

Updates to this status document should be made regularly as features are implemented.
